## 📐 Architecture

![System Architecture](docs/system_architecture.png)

**Pipeline Components:**
1. **Two-Tower Retrieval** - Learns user-video embeddings (Recall@100: 1.9%)
2. **Fraud Detection** - User-level risk scoring (ROC-AUC: 1.00 on synthetic data)
3. **Integrity Policy** - Multi-layer filtering (safety + adaptive manipulation)
4. **Serving API** - FastAPI with pre-computed artifacts for fast inference

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python 3.10-3.12 required
pip install tensorflow polars scikit-learn fastapi uvicorn streamlit requests plotly
```

### Run API Server
```bash
# Start FastAPI server (loads all models on startup)
uvicorn serving.api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Server will initialize:
# - Two-Tower retrieval model (weights + vocabs)
# - Pre-computed video embeddings (50K × 128)
# - Pre-computed fraud scores (105K users)
# - Video metadata with content safety scores
```

### Run Demo
```bash
# Launch Streamlit demo
streamlit run app_demo.py

# Demo features:
# - Fraud score override slider (0.0 - 1.0)
# - Funnel visualization (retrieval → filtering → output)
# - Side-by-side low vs high risk comparison
```

### Test API
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/

# Get user fraud score
curl http://localhost:8000/risk/user_100

# Get personalized feed (20 videos, with stats)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/feed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user_100",
    "num_videos": 20,
    "include_stats": true
  }'

# Test high-risk filtering (fraud override)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/feed \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user_100",
    "num_videos": 20,
    "include_stats": true,
    "fraud_score_override": 0.9
  }'
```

## 🎯 Technical Highlights

### 1. Production-Ready Serving
- **Pre-computed embeddings** - 50K video embeddings loaded at startup (O(1) lookup)
- **Pre-computed fraud scores** - 105K user scores in memory (no model inference)
- **5× candidate headroom** - Retrieve 100 videos for 20-video feed to account for filtering
- **Defensive validation** - Embedding normalization, null handling, vocabulary alignment checks

### 2. Adaptive Integrity Policy
```python
# Tiered manipulation thresholds (fraud-based)
fraud < 0.3:        threshold = 0.7  # Lenient (organic users)
0.3 ≤ fraud < 0.7:  threshold = 0.5  # Moderate
fraud ≥ 0.7:        threshold = 0.3  # Strict (bots)

# Fixed content safety thresholds (uniform)
NSFW < 0.5, Violence < 0.7, Hate Speech < 0.6
```

**Why this works:** High-risk users face 2.3× stricter manipulation filtering without impacting legitimate content safety standards.

### 3. Key Engineering Decisions

| Challenge | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **TensorFlow SavedModel fails (Python 3.12)** | Weights-only export + rebuild script | Worked around serialization bug, kept serving fast |
| **Bot users have no signup timestamps** | Stratified random splits | Ensured bot representation in all splits |
| **5M interactions in memory** | Polars (not pandas) | 3-5× faster processing, lower memory |
| **Retrieval latency** | Pre-compute all video embeddings | User embedding only (1 vector vs 50K) |
| **Fraud model calibration** | Isotonic (not Platt scaling) | Better for imbalanced data (5% bots) |

## 📈 Trade-offs & Limitations

### What's Good
✅ Fast serving (pre-computed artifacts, vectorized ops)
✅ Adaptive filtering (fraud-aware thresholds)
✅ Explainable pipeline (funnel stats, clear filtering stages)
✅ Production patterns (defensive checks, stratified splits, calibration)

### What's Missing (Production Considerations)
❌ **A/B testing framework** - Need engagement vs. safety metrics
❌ **Online learning** - Models are static after training
❌ **Real-time fraud detection** - Pre-computed scores only
❌ **Diversity optimization** - No explicit diversification in retrieval
❌ **Real production data** - Synthetic data has perfect metrics

### Known Limitations
- **Perfect fraud AUC (1.00)** - Synthetic data has unrealistic separation
- **Low Recall@100 (1.9%)** - Only 3 training epochs, need 10-20 for convergence
- **No cold-start handling** - Unknown users default to 0.05 fraud score
- **Static thresholds** - No dynamic threshold tuning based on catalog drift

## 🧪 Evidence & Quality Gate (Day 8)

**Integration Tests:** 8/8 passed ✅
- Health check, risk endpoint, feed endpoint
- Unknown user defaults, fraud override (0.0/1.0)
- Empty result resilience, funnel stats

**Integrity Evaluation:** Adaptive threshold impact measured across 300 users

| Scenario | Fraud Score | Threshold | Blocked (Manip) | Impact |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Lenient | 0.0 | 0.70 | 11.1 videos | Baseline |
| Actual | Real (~0.0) | 0.70 | 11.1 videos | Same |
| Medium | 0.5 | 0.50 | 21.9 videos | **+96.9%** |
| Strict | 0.9 | 0.30 | 29.2 videos | **+162.3%** |

**Key Finding:** High-risk users experience 2.6× higher manipulation filtering via adaptive thresholds, while the system guarantees a stable feed size (Top-N = 20) across all fraud tiers.

**Performance Benchmarks:** (Google Colab, warm cache, N=200-300 requests)

| Endpoint | p50 | p95 | p99 | Note |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|------|
| **/feed** | 19.9 ms | **38.9 ms** | 86.8 ms | Full pipeline |
| **/risk** | 4.5 ms | **9.4 ms** | 13.0 ms | O(1) lookup |

- **Memory:** 4.5 GB RSS (includes models, embeddings, metadata)
- **Startup:** 3-8s (measured from logs)
- **Success rate:** 100% (300/300 requests)

**Artifacts:**
- `docs/integration_test_results.json` - E2E test results
- `evaluation/day8_integrity_report.json` - Policy impact analysis
- `evaluation/day8_perf.json` - Performance benchmarks

**Trade-offs:**
- Benchmarks on shared Colab CPU (production would use dedicated instances)
- Warm-cache measurements (cold-start adds ~1-2s for first request)
- Synthetic data (perfect fraud separation, lower recall than production)


## 🎤 Interview Talking Points

### "Walk me through your project"
> "I built an end-to-end content recommendation system with adaptive fraud-based filtering. The system combines a Two-Tower retrieval model with multi-layer integrity checks that automatically adjust strictness based on user risk. High-risk users face 2.4× more aggressive manipulation filtering while maintaining consistent feed quality. The entire pipeline is production-ready with pre-computed embeddings for sub-second serving latency."

### "What was your biggest challenge?"
> "TensorFlow's SavedModel export failed in Python 3.12 due to serialization bugs. I pivoted to a weights-only approach with vocabulary rebuilding, which required careful architecture matching and defensive validation. This taught me to design for failure modes early—I now always have a fallback strategy for critical infrastructure components."

### "How would you deploy this?"
> "Four components: (1) Batch jobs to refresh embeddings and fraud scores daily, (2) FastAPI service with health checks and load balancing, (3) Redis/Memcached for hot-path caching if latency becomes critical, and (4) A/B testing framework to measure engagement vs. safety trade-offs. I'd also add percentile latency monitoring (p50/p95/p99) and gradual rollout with feature flags."
